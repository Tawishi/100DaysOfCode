***LOG 1: Trial 1***

# Day 01
Completed the _Missing Number_ problem. <br>
Things I learnt today,
* STL in C++ is not always helpful
* Taking a break is OK (even in a 1 hour task) <br><br>
Steps to the solution : 
1. Used vectors and exceeded the time limit
2. Used arrays
    1. sort() in STL
    2. revisiting array indexing
# Day 02
Completed the _Repetitions_ problem. <br>
Things I learnt today,
* Always remember to comment the debugging code <br><br>
Steps to the solution :
1. Today it was mostly working out the logic
2. max_element() used
# Day 03
Completed the _Increasing array_ problem. <br>
Looked at the _Permutations_ problem.
# Day 04
Tried solving _Permutations_ problem.<br>
Program should print one beautiful permutation, if possible, for input n. Learned about:
1. size_t data type in C++
2. vector::back()
# Day 05
Moved one-step closer to solving _Permutations_ problem.<br>
# Day 06
Trying to solve _Permutations_ problem.<br>
# Day 07
Solved _Permutations_ problem.<br>
Tried _Number Spiral_ problem.
>Sometimes we just need to shake things up.
# Day 08
Solved _Number Spiral_ problem.
# Day 09
Solved _Bit Strings_ problem. <br>
Learned : 
* mod properties
* overcome bit storage limitations in system
# Day 10
Solved _Two Sets_ problem.
# Day 11
Solved _Trailing Zeros_ problem.
# Day 12
Solved _Coin Piles_ problem.
# Day 13
Solved _Pallindrome Reorder_ problem. <br>
