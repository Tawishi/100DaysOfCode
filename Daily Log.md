# Day 01
Completed the _Missing Number_ problem. <br>
Things I learnt today,
* STL in C++ is not always helpful
* Taking a break is OK (even in a 1 hour task) <br><br>
Steps to the solution : 
1. Used vectors and exceeded the time limit
2. Used arrays
    1. sort() in STL
    2. revisiting array indexing
# Day 02
Completed the _Repetitions_ problem. <br>
Things I learnt today,
* Always remember to comment the debugging code <br><br>
Steps to the solution :
1. Today it was mostly working out the logic
2. max_element() used
# Day 03
Completed the _Increasing array_ problem. <br>
Looked at the _Permutations_ problem.
# Day 04
Tried solving _Permutations_ problem.<br>
Program should print one beatiful permutation, if possible, for input n. Leared about:
1. size_t data type in C++
2. vector::back()
