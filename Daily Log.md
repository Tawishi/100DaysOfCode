# Day 01
Completed the Missing Number problem today. <br>
Things I learnt today,
1. STL in C++ is not always helpful
2. Taking a break is OK (even in a 1 hour task) <br><br>
Steps to the solution : 
1. Used vectors and exceeded the time limit
2. Used arrays
    1. sort() in STL
    2. revisiting array indexing
